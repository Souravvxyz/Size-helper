        Understanding your clothing size is key—especially when shopping online for matching family pajamas or active wear. Our tool uses pre‐defined height and weight brackets along with your body type to generate a general size recommendation.
      </p>
      <p>
        The height and weight categories were created based on standard size guides. For example, a person in the "160-169 cm" bracket combined with the "60-69 kg" bracket generally falls into a medium size. Adjustments are then made based on whether you’re slim (suggesting a smaller size) or heavy (suggesting a larger size).
      </p>
      <p>
        This tool is designed to simplify your shopping experience and reduce the guesswork associated with sizing. It is especially useful during the busy holiday season when coordinating looks for matching family outfits is a fun way to celebrate.
