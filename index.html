        Knowing your clothing size is crucial, especially during the holidays when you want everything to fit just right. Our Holiday Size Finder tool combines several factors—including BMI (calculated from your weight and height), body type, and even height adjustments—to give you a personalized size recommendation.
      </p>
      <p>
        The algorithm starts with well-established BMI thresholds and then fine-tunes the result by considering if you are shorter than 160 cm or taller than 180 cm, ensuring the size is not just based on weight alone. This helps account for different body proportions and overall stature.
      </p>
      <p>
        Additionally, we adjust the size further based on your body type. If you are naturally slim, our tool suggests a slightly smaller size, whereas if you are on the heavier side, it recommends going up one size. This nuanced approach helps reduce the hassle of returns and makes online shopping much more efficient.
      </p>
