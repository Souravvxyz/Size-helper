        Understanding your clothing size is essential, especially during the holiday season. Our Holiday Size Finder uses your body weight, height, and type to calculate your BMI—an internationally recognized indicator of body composition—to offer a general size recommendation. This way, you can shop with confidence for festive attire.
      </p>
      <p>
        The tool applies standard BMI thresholds: under 18.5 for underweight, 18.5 to 24.9 for normal weight, 25 to 29.9 for overweight, and 30 or above for obesity. By correlating these ranges with sizes (S, M, L, XL) and adjusting for body type, the tool gives you a starting point for selecting clothes that will likely fit well.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether you’re looking to coordinate with family for matching pajamas or find the perfect outfit for a cozy winter day, our tool simplifies the process and reduces the guesswork. It’s a practical guide designed to help you avoid the hassle of returns and exchanges when shopping online.
      </p>
